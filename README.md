# Nimi-Dev Ecommerce
                                                             
## Project Description:

The Nimi-Dev-Ecommerce application is a Ecommerce application where customers can go through the Products and buy them according to their needs.

## Features:

```bash
Employee/Customer Login.
Customer Registration.
Employee Product Management.
Customer can view and Search Products.
Cart Functionality.
```

## Technologies:

This app is made using MERN(MongoDB,ExpressJS,ReactJS,NodeJS) stack.
Reason :- Since it's a I/O heavy application JS is the fastest and easiest way to develop(According to my opinion).Alt 
considered Spring boot - Backend.

## How to get Started with your app

### Prerequisites:

 1. NPM Package Manager.
 2. NodeJS.
 3. Browser compatible with JavaScript.

### Procedure of setting up prerequisites and run the project:

 1. Install npm.
 2. Install node.
 3. Open the app using a appropriate IDE(VSC,Webstorm)
 4. Run "npm install" on the default project location.
 5. Run "npm install" inside the client folder.
 6. Go back to the default location and run "npm run dev"(App is running concurrently).
 
 ### Features I would you add if i had more Time :
 
 1. Add a Payment Gateway - Current application only contains dummy Payment where it will only validate customer details.
 2. Payment receipt - Add the Mail functionality for a Successful payment transaction.
 3. Admin Panel - Current application only contain Employee login. Create employee, profile management,  employee management.. would be great to add.
 4. User Profile Handling - User profile management, forget/reset password features would be great to add.
 5. Add more Validations/test cases.
